Do you ever wonder how shell scripts work? Shell scripts are a powerful way to automate tasks and make your life easier. They can be used to request user input, process the data, and provide meaningful output. In this blog post, we’ll explore an example of a shell script that requests the user to input information and reply with either “Sorry You Are Out” or “You Were Lucky – Congratulations!” if they exceed 80 marks above. 

To begin our exploration of this type of script, let's consider what it would look like in action: when prompted by the script for their mark (from 0-100), users enter their score into the command line interface. If they receive more than 80 points on their exam/test/quiz/etc., then congratulations - they have passed! On the other hand, if they fail to reach that threshold then unfortunately it is time for them say goodbye as "Sorry You Are Out". 
  			   

 The actual code behind such an automated task could look something like this: 

 #!/bin/bash  

 echo "Please enter your mark:"  

 read MARKS #reads in user's entered value    

 if [ $MARKS -gt 80 ] ;then      #compares entered value against set condition     echo "Congratulations!"    else      echo "Sorry You Are Out" fi        This simple piece of code demonstrates how quickly one can create a basic but effective shell scripting tool which allows users interact with computers through text-based commands rather than graphical interfaces alone; making automation easier and faster than ever before!       Of course there are many different ways one could go about writing such a program depending upon specific requirements; however regardless which approach is taken all will share some common elements including conditions (if statements) for determining success or failure based upon certain criteria being met or not met respectively .        Hopefully after reading through this blog post you now have greater insight into what goes into creating these types of programs as well better appreciation just how powerful tools shells scripts really can be when used correctly!
